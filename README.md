#BERT Base Embeddings
This notebook demonstrates how to use BERT Base to generate sentence embeddings for text using TensorFlow and TensorFlow Hub. It includes steps for preprocessing text data to make it compatible with the BERT model and extracting embeddings from it.

##Overview
The notebook covers the following steps:

Importing necessary libraries from TensorFlow and TensorFlow Hub.
Preprocessing input text using the BERT tokenizer, which prepares the text for the BERT model by tokenizing and creating attention masks.
Loading the BERT model for embedding extraction.
Extracting embeddings (both token-wise and pooled) from the text.

Key Concepts
Preprocessing: The text is tokenized and converted into input format suitable for the BERT model using TensorFlow Hub's BERT preprocessing layer.
Embeddings: The notebook extracts both the sequence output (embeddings for each token) and the pooled output (a fixed-size embedding for the entire input sequence).
Pooled Output: The pooled output is commonly used in classification tasks and represents the final hidden state of the [CLS] token in BERT.

Install the dependencies using:
bash
`pip install tensorflow tensorflow-hub tensorflow-text`

Usage
